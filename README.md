# Expense reimbursement system

## This project served two purposes. 
1. To get a more in depth knowledge of _**Single Page Applications**_ (**SPA**) by creating one from scratch. 
1. To create a Expense Reimbursement System (ERS) which manages the process of reimbursing employees for expenses incurred while on company time. 

### The system allows
* All employees in the company can login and submit requests for reimbursement and view their past tickets and pending requests. 
* Finance managers can log in and view all reimbursement requests and past history for all employees in the company. 
* Finance managers are authorized to approve and deny requests for expense reimbursement.
